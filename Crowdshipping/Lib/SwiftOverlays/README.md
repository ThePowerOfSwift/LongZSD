- [x] Wait overlay with text

- [x] Overlay with text only
- [x] Overlay with image and text (can be used with [PPSwiftGifs](https://github.com/peterprokop/PPSwiftGifs) to show custom animated GIF instead of UIActivityIndicatorView)
- [x] Notification on top of the status bar, similar to native iOS local/push notifications

// (Wait overlay)

let text = "Please wait..."
self.showWaitOverlayWithText(text)
// (Wait overlay with text)

let text = "This is a text-only overlay...\n...spanning several lines"
self.showTextOverlay(text)
